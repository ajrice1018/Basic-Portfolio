        <p>My name is Andrew Rice. I am 30 years old and was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. I moved a great deal while I was growing having moved 11 times and living 9 different states. Because of this moving I was lucky enough to have visited the entirety of the continental United States. But that's enough about where I've been, now onto more about myself!!!</p>
        <p>I am an avid listener of music and I would say it is one of the most important things in my life. I listen to all sorts of different music and get a lot of inspiration for music from local indepedent radio station KEXP where I am also a volunteer. I love music so much that some friends and I started up a tape label. The tape label is called Den Tapes and puts out exclusively local Seattle bands. Many of them are punk bands but we have also put out others.</p>
        <p>Look forward to meeting and working with everyone in class!!!</p>
